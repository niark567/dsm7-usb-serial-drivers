## Import from Jadahl.com (Oct 2022)

Since the website Jadahl.com, another good source of DSM modules, has been offline for some time and doesn't look like it might be coming back, I retrieved all modules that were posted there (via https://web.archive.org) and added them to this repository. Thank you very much to the person that ran it ðŸ˜Š

### Supported drivers

* `cp210x`
* `ch341`
* `pl2303` (not for all platforms)
* `ti_usb_3410_5052` (not for all platforms)

### Supported platforms

See [the modules/ directory](https://github.com/robertklep/dsm7-usb-serial-drivers/tree/main/modules).

Drivers for DSM 7.0 are available for most platforms, drivers for DSM 7.1 are slowly being added. If you're missing drivers for a particular platform, please [open an issue](https://github.com/robertklep/dsm7-usb-serial-drivers/issues) and I see what I can do (please also add the kernel version of your platform to your issue, you can find that out with `uname -a` from a terminal).

### Which platform does my Synology use?

Find your Synology model [on this page](https://kb.synology.com/en-uk/DSM/tutorial/What_kind_of_CPU_does_my_NAS_have) and check the "Package Arch" column (second last).

### Downloading a module

Github is a bit confusing if you want to download binary files like this repository provides.

For instance, if you [go to this page](https://github.com/robertklep/dsm7-usb-serial-drivers/tree/main/modules/geminilake/dsm-7.1), the links to the `.ko` files are _not_ download links, they will just bring you to the [information page for that particular file](https://github.com/robertklep/dsm7-usb-serial-drivers/blob/main/modules/geminilake/dsm-7.1/cp210x.ko).

From there, you can download the actual binary module file using the "Download" button in the bottom square in the page.

### Installation

NB: the following steps will require SSH access and administrator rights. For the latter, either use `sudo` for each command or use `su` to log in as root.

* The kernel modules for each supported platform can be found in `modules/`. Copy the required files to your Synology and move them to `/lib/modules`
* To get DSM 7 to load the modules at boot time, copy the included file `usb-serial-drivers.sh` to `/usr/local/etc/rc.d`
* Make sure that the file has executable permissions:
  `chmod +x /usr/local/etc/rc.d/usb-serial-drivers.sh`

You don't need to reboot your NAS for the modules to load, just execute the script after you completed the previous steps:
```
# /usr/local/etc/rc.d/usb-serial-drivers.sh start
```

#### Alternative method of loading modules at boot

This method is explained [in this comment](https://github.com/robertklep/dsm7-usb-serial-drivers/issues/75#issuecomment-1554853821) by @GravityRZ:

* Create a file named `95-usb-serial.conf` in the directory `/usr/lib/modules-load.d`
* Set the correct permissions for the file: `sudo chmod 644 /usr/lib/modules-load.d/95-usb-serial.conf`
* Edit the file and add the modules that need to be loaded at boot. All modules _require_ that `usbserial.ko` is loaded too, so make sure to add that first.

  For example, to load the `ch341.ko` module, add the following to the file:
  ```
  usbserial.ko
  ch341.ko
  ```

### Building from source

I've built these modules in an Ubuntu 18.04.5 virtual machine on my Synology NAS.

To set up the build environment, I followed the steps [in this document](https://help.synology.com/developer-guide/getting_started/prepare_environment.html). The different NAS targets/platforms can be installed next to each other.

To build the modules for a particular platform, I follow these steps:
```
sudo rm -fr /toolkit/build_env/ds.$platform-7.0/source
sudo /toolkit/pkgscripts-ng/PkgCreate.py -X 0 -P 1 -v 7.0 --min-sdk 7.0 -p $platform $module
cp -v /toolkit/build_env/ds.$platform-7.0/source/$module/*.ko /tmp
```

Replace `$platform` with the NAS platform, for example `apollolake`.
Replace `$module` with the source directory name (found in `sources/` in this repository) relevant for that particular platform. For example, `apollolake` requires the `4.4.x` sources.

Put together, to build for `apollolake`, the commands become:
```
sudo rm -fr /toolkit/build_env/ds.apollolake-7.0/source
sudo /toolkit/pkgscripts-ng/PkgCreate.py -X 0 -P 1 -v 7.0 --min-sdk 7.0 -p apollolake 4.4.x
cp -v /toolkit/build_env/ds.apollolake-7.0/source/$module/*.ko /tmp
```

Due to some concurrency issues that I haven't bothered to look into, the second step (`PkgCreate`) sometimes fails with a compilation error. If that happens, start over.

The last step will copy the driver modules to `/tmp`

### Disclaimer

I don't/can't test every driver. Use at your own peril.

### Attribution

I'm using the source code (as-is) for the drivers included in the Linux kernel from the [Synology Open Source Project](https://sourceforge.net/projects/dsgpl/) and the [Synology Toolchain GPL sources](https://archive.synology.com/download/ToolChain/Synology%20NAS%20GPL%20Source/).
